  <core_principles>
    1. **Symmetry & Balance:** A layout that projects stability and fairness, mirroring the scales of justice.
    2. **Typographic Authority:** Using strong, high-contrast serif headings to command attention without shouting.
    3. **Materiality:** Evoking the feel of premium paper stock and engraved stationery through texture and subtle shadows.
    4. **Clarity of Purpose:** Every element has a distinct place; no clutter, just essential information presented with weight.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **"The Gavel & The Parchment"**
    - **Deep Navy (#0F172A):** Used for primary backgrounds and heavy structural elements to ground the design.
    - **Ivory (#FDFBF7):** A warm, paper-like background for reading areas, reducing eye strain and adding a touch of history.
    - **Hunter Green (#1B4D3E):** Used for call-to-action buttons and accent lines, representing growth and prosperity.
    - *Reasoning:* This palette feels established and expensive, avoiding the sterility of pure white and blue.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **The Columnar Grid:**
    - Inspired by legal briefs and architectural columns.
    - Content is organized into distinct vertical tracks.
    - Sidebar navigation or split-screen layouts for profile pages to keep context visible.
    - "Card" elements are sharp-edged or have very minimal rounding (2px), reinforcing the "structured" requirement.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Vertical Divider Lines:** Thin, elegant lines separating content columns, reminiscent of legal documents.
    2. **Monogram Watermarks:** A subtle, large "AL" monogram faded into the background of section breaks.
    3. **Gold Foil Accents:** Very sparing use of a metallic gold gradient on hover states or key borders to add a "seal of approval" feel.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **"Deliberate & Weighty"**
    - Interactions should feel solid, not bouncy.
    - Hover effects are slow fades or subtle color shifts, not rapid movements.
    - Modals and dropdowns appear with a crisp, confident snap.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    - **Parallax Scroll:** Slow, dignified movement of background images behind text.
    - **Text Reveal:** Headings slide up slowly from a mask, synchronized with scroll.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    - **Headings:** *Playfair Display* (Serif) - High contrast, elegant, authoritative.
    - **Body:** *Lato* or *Source Sans Pro* (Sans-serif) - Clean, legible, modern, providing a functional contrast to the ornate headings.
    - **Accents:** *Cinzel* (Serif) - For small caps labels and navigation, adding a Roman inscription feel.
