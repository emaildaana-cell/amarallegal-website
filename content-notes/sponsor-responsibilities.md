## Introduction
"Many people confuse the role of an immigration court sponsor (for bond purposes) with a USCIS sponsor (for green card applications). While both involve supporting an immigrant, their legal obligations are completely different. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for anyone considering becoming a sponsor."

## Key Differences at a Glance

### Immigration Court Sponsor
"A person who agrees to provide housing and support for someone released from ICE detention on bond while their immigration case is pending."

**Primary Purpose:** Ensure the person appears at immigration court hearings and provide temporary housing

### USCIS Sponsor (Form I-864)
"A U.S. citizen or permanent resident who signs a legally binding contract to financially support an immigrant applying for a green card."

**Primary Purpose:** Guarantee the immigrant will not become a public charge and provide financial support if needed

## What a Court Sponsor Must Do:
1. **Provide Housing** - Offer a place for the detained person to live while their immigration case is pending. This can be a room in your home, an apartment, or any safe living arrangement.
2. **Ensure Court Appearance** - Help the person attend all scheduled immigration court hearings and check-ins with ICE. This is the most critical responsibility—missing a hearing can result in deportation.
3. **Provide Contact Information** - Give your address and phone number to the immigration court and ICE so they can contact the person you are sponsoring.
4. **Report Address Changes** - Notify ICE and the immigration court within 10 days if the person moves to a different address.
5. **Provide Basic Support** - While not legally required, sponsors typically help with basic needs like food, transportation to court, and emotional support during the stressful legal process.

## What a Court Sponsor is NOT Required to Do:
- You are NOT legally obligated to provide financial support beyond housing
- You are NOT responsible for repaying government benefits if the person receives public assistance
- You are NOT entering into a long-term financial contract—your responsibilities generally end when the immigration case concludes

## FAQ Section

### Can I be both an immigration court sponsor and a USCIS sponsor for the same person?
Yes, you can be both. Many people sponsor someone for bond release from detention and later sponsor them for a green card. However, remember that these are separate processes with different obligations.

### What happens if I signed Form I-864 but can no longer afford to support the immigrant?
Unfortunately, signing Form I-864 creates a legally binding obligation that cannot be easily terminated. Your obligation continues even if your financial situation changes, you divorce the immigrant, or you no longer have contact with them. The immigrant or the government can sue you to enforce the contract.

### Can I withdraw as an immigration court sponsor if I change my mind?
Yes, you can withdraw as a court sponsor, but you must notify ICE and the immigration court immediately. The person you were sponsoring may be taken back into detention if they cannot find another sponsor.

### Do I need to be a U.S. citizen to be a sponsor?
For immigration court sponsorship (bond), you do not need to be a U.S. citizen or even a legal resident. Anyone can be a court sponsor. However, for USCIS sponsorship (Form I-864), you must be either a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident (green card holder) who meets the income requirements.

### Will being a sponsor affect my ability to receive government benefits?
Being an immigration court sponsor should not affect your benefits. However, if you are a USCIS sponsor (Form I-864) and the immigrant receives certain public benefits, the government may seek reimbursement from you.

### What if the person I sponsored disappears or stops going to court?
If you are a court sponsor and the person misses their immigration court hearing, they will likely receive a deportation order. You should contact their attorney and ICE immediately.

### Can I sponsor someone if I have a criminal record?
For immigration court sponsorship, having a criminal record does not automatically disqualify you, but it may affect the judge's decision to grant bond. For USCIS sponsorship (Form I-864), a criminal record does not disqualify you as long as you meet the income requirements.

### How much does it cost to be a sponsor?
Immigration court sponsorship has no filing fees—you simply provide housing and ensure court attendance. USCIS sponsorship (Form I-864) requires filing fees for the green card application (currently $1,760 for most family-based applications) plus the long-term financial obligation.
