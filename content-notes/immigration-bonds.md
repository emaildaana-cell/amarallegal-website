- Subtitle: "If you are detained by immigration authorities, you have the right to request a bond hearing before an immigration judge. Learn how we can help you secure release while your case proceeds."

## What is an Immigration Court Bond Hearing?
"An immigration bond hearing is a proceeding before an immigration judge where you can request release from detention while your immigration case is pending. The judge has the authority to set, reduce, or deny bond based on whether you pose a flight risk or danger to the community.

Bond hearings are separate from your removal (deportation) hearings. Even if ICE has denied you bond or set a bond amount you cannot afford, you have the right to ask an immigration judge to reconsider. This is called a bond redetermination hearing.

Securing release on bond allows you to fight your immigration case from outside detention, reconnect with family, continue working, and work closely with your attorney to build the strongest possible defense."

## Who is Eligible for a Bond Hearing?

### Generally Eligible for Bond:
- Individuals detained under INA § 236(a) (non-mandatory detention)
- Those without serious criminal convictions
- Asylum seekers who passed credible fear interviews
- Individuals with strong community ties and family in the U.S.
- Those who have been detained for prolonged periods

### Subject to Mandatory Detention:
- Individuals with aggravated felony convictions
- Those convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude
- Individuals detained under INA § 236(c) (mandatory detention)
- Arriving aliens in expedited removal proceedings
- Those deemed national security threats

Note: Even if subject to mandatory detention, there may be legal challenges available. Consult with an attorney.

## The Bond Hearing Process (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Request a Bond Hearing
**Submit Written Request or Ask at Master Calendar Hearing**

You must request a bond hearing—it will not be automatically scheduled. You can request a bond hearing in two ways:
- **Orally:** Ask the immigration judge at your first master calendar hearing
- **In Writing:** Submit a written motion to the immigration court requesting a bond hearing

**Important:** Request a bond hearing as soon as possible after being detained. The sooner you request it, the sooner you can potentially be released.

### Step 2: Prepare Evidence and Documentation
**Gather Supporting Materials**

The burden of proof is on you to show that you are not a flight risk or danger to the community. Strong evidence is essential to convince the judge to grant bond.

**Community Ties:**
- Family relationships (spouse, children, parents in U.S.)
- Employment history and job offers
- Property ownership or lease agreements
- Community involvement and references

**Good Character:**
- Letters of support from family, employers, community
- Evidence of rehabilitation (if applicable)
- Clean criminal record or explanation of past issues
- Proof of compliance with previous court orders

### Step 3: Attend the Bond Hearing
**Present Your Case Before the Immigration Judge**

At the bond hearing, you will appear before an immigration judge. The hearing typically includes:
- **Opening statements:** Your attorney explains why you should be released on bond
- **Evidence presentation:** Submit documents and call witnesses to testify on your behalf
- **Your testimony:** You will testify about your ties to the community, family, employment, and why you will appear for future hearings
- **Government's position:** The ICE attorney may argue against bond or request a higher amount
- **Judge's decision:** The judge will either grant bond (and set an amount), deny bond, or continue the hearing for more evidence

**Critical:** Having an experienced immigration attorney represent you at the bond hearing significantly increases your chances of success.

### Step 4: Judge Sets Bond Amount
**Typical Range: $1,500 to $25,000+**

If the judge grants bond, they will set a bond amount based on several factors:
- Strength of community ties
- Immigration history and prior violations
- Criminal history (if any)
- Flight risk assessment
- Financial resources of the individual and family

**Bond Amount Guidelines:**
- **Minimum bond:** Typically $1,500 (set by regulation)
- **Average bond:** $5,000 - $10,000 for most cases
- **Higher bonds:** $15,000 - $25,000+ for those with criminal history or weak ties

### Step 5: Post Bond and Secure Release
**Payment and Release Process**

Once the judge sets a bond amount, the bond must be posted before release. There are two ways to pay:

**Cash Bond (Full Amount):**
- Pay the full bond amount to ICE
- Must be paid by a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident
- Payment via money order, cashier's check, or U.S. bonds
- **Refundable** when case concludes (if all hearings attended)

**Immigration Bond Company:**
- Pay 15-20% premium to bond company
- Bond company posts full amount with ICE
- Faster process, less upfront money required
- **Premium is non-refundable**

**Release Timeline:** After bond is posted, release typically occurs within 24-72 hours, depending on the detention facility's processing time.
