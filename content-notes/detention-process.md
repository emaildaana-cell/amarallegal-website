## The Detention Process: Step by Step

### Step 1: Arrest by ICE
**Day 1 - Initial Contact**

ICE officers may arrest individuals at their home, workplace, during routine check-ins, or after release from local law enforcement custody. Officers must identify themselves and present proper credentials.

**Your Rights During Arrest:**
- Right to remain silent (except for providing your name)
- Right to refuse to sign any documents without an attorney
- Right to contact your consulate if you are not a U.S. citizen
- Right to make a phone call to notify family or attorney

### Step 2: Initial Processing
**Day 1-2 - Documentation and Fingerprinting**

After arrest, you will be taken to a local ICE office or processing center for initial intake. This includes:
- Fingerprinting and photographing
- Background checks and criminal history review
- Medical screening for communicable diseases
- Assignment of an Alien Registration Number (A-Number)
- Completion of biographical information forms

**Important:** Do not sign any documents, especially voluntary departure forms, without speaking to an attorney first. Signing certain documents can waive your right to see an immigration judge.

### Step 3: Custody Determination
**Day 2-3 - Bond Eligibility Review**

ICE will make a custody determination to decide whether you will be held in detention or released. This decision considers:
- Whether you are subject to mandatory detention
- Your criminal history and immigration violations
- Flight risk assessment and community ties
- Danger to the community evaluation

**May Be Eligible for Bond:**
- No serious criminal convictions
- Strong community ties
- No prior immigration violations
- Not subject to mandatory detention

**Mandatory Detention (No Bond):**
- Certain criminal convictions
- Aggravated felonies
- Crimes of moral turpitude
- National security concerns

### Step 4: Transfer to Detention Facility
**Day 3-7 - Facility Assignment**

If you are not released, you will be transferred to an ICE detention facility. Facilities can be:
- ICE Processing Centers (dedicated immigration facilities)
- Contract Detention Facilities (privately operated)
- County jails with ICE contracts

Once at the facility, you will receive an orientation about rules, visitation, phone access, and your rights. You should appear in the ICE Detainee Locator system within 24-48 hours of transfer.

### Step 5: Notice to Appear (NTA)
**Within 10 Days - Formal Charges**

You will receive a Notice to Appear (NTA), which is the formal charging document that begins removal proceedings. The NTA includes:
- Allegations of immigration law violations
- Charges of removability (deportability)
- Date, time, and location of your first hearing
- Your rights in immigration court

**Critical:** Keep all copies of the NTA and any other documents you receive. These are essential for your attorney to build your defense.

### Step 6: Master Calendar Hearing
**2-4 Weeks - First Court Appearance**

Your first hearing before an immigration judge is called a Master Calendar Hearing. This is a brief procedural hearing where:
- The judge reviews the charges against you
- You admit or deny the allegations
- You indicate what relief from removal you may seek
- The judge schedules future hearings
- Bond hearings may be requested

Detained cases typically move faster than non-detained cases. You may have multiple master calendar hearings before your individual (merits) hearing is scheduled.

### Step 7: Bond Hearing (If Eligible)
**Varies - Request for Release**

If ICE did not set a bond or if you believe the bond amount is too high, you can request a bond hearing before an immigration judge. The judge will consider:
- Whether you are a flight risk
- Whether you pose a danger to the community
- Your ties to the United States (family, employment, property)
- Your immigration and criminal history

If the judge grants bond, the amount typically ranges from $1,500 to $25,000 or more depending on the circumstances. Bond must be posted in full before release.

### Step 8: Individual (Merits) Hearing
**Months to Years - Full Trial**

The individual hearing is your full trial before the immigration judge. This is where you present your case for relief from removal, such as:
- Cancellation of removal
- Asylum or withholding of removal
- Adjustment of status
- Voluntary departure

You will present evidence, call witnesses, and testify on your own behalf. The government attorney will also present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. The judge will issue a decision either at the hearing or in writing later.

### Step 9: Judge's Decision and Appeals
**Final Outcome**

After the individual hearing, the judge will issue a decision to either:
- Grant relief and terminate removal proceedings
- Order removal (deportation) from the United States

If the judge orders removal, you have 30 days to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The government can also appeal if you win. During the appeal, you may remain in detention or be released on bond depending on your circumstances.

**Note:** If your appeal is denied and all legal options are exhausted, ICE will schedule your removal from the United States. You will be returned to your country of citizenship or another country that will accept you.
